      <title>Broken links</title>

      <description>What is going on? A while back I noticed that all of my cross post anchor links are broken. They no longer link to anchors within the post, but instead link to the post itself. I planned on resolving this quickly, but it turned out to be more involved then I had hopped. In order to resolve the issue I needed to first register as a contributor of GNU emacs which I discussed here.</description>

      <title>Staticman with GitHub and Zeit Now - part 1</title>

      <description>Why Staticman? I would like to add comment support to my Blog. The trouble is that I don&amp;rsquo;t trust comment engines to respect the privacy of my readers. Do I even have any readers? Who can tell! None of my posts have a comment section and I don&amp;rsquo;t collect analytics. Clearly this is a problem worth solving.
I recently came across the Staticman comment engine which uses pull requests to update static blogs with static user comments.</description>

      <description>A quick note about my use of Literate Programming My blog is generated using a static site generator called Hugo. Hugo naively supports both Markdown and Org-Mode format, so naturally I have chosen to compose my blog posts in emacs Org-Mode. Org-mode is similar to Markdown in the sense that it uses a simple plain text markup syntax for formatting documents. However, Org-Mode has far more features than Markdown and has fantastic literate programming support via Org-Babel.</description>
