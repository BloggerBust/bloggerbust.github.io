      <description>About Me I am a software developer and independent contractor residing in Edmonton Alberta, Canada. I have been developing software professionally since 2001 and graduated from the University of Alberta in 2005 with a major Mathematics and minor in computing science. One thing that I love about being an independent contractor is that over the years I have worked for lots of different companies which has allowed me to contribute to a large variety of exciting projects written in plenty of different languages.</description>
