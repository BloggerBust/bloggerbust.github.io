      <description>What is the issue If I create a link to a local heading a header link, the browser renders the link relative to the webroot. If you click on the link it will navigate the browser to the webroot and query for the anchor from that location rather than the current document. The same issue happens when tring to link to a footnote 1.
Footnotes  this is a footnote. [return]   </description>

      <description>About Me I am a software developer and independent contractor residing in Edmonton Alberta, Canada. I have been developing software professionally since 2001 and graduated from the University of Alberta in 2005 with a major Mathematics and minor in computing science. One thing that I love about being an independent contractor is that over the years I have worked for lots of different companies which has allowed me to contribute to a large variety of exciting projects written in plenty of different languages.</description>
