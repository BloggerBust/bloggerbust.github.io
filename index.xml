      <description>A quick recap In the previous article titled Separate Dependencies From Implementation Using POSIX ACL Extended Attributes &amp;amp; Docker, I discussed the prerequisites to provide read and write access to a volume shared between the host system and guest docker container. My proposal involved encapsulating all of the project dependencies inside of the docker container while keeping the project&amp;rsquo;s source code and development tools on the host. There are clear benefits to this approach.</description>

      <description>The motivation I am going to develop a responsive web-extension using angular. The web-extension is for a project that I am starting called nauci. I will talk about nauci more in future posts. In this post I intend to introduce the nauci base entry docker image and how I am using it to encapsulate the nauci project dependencies in a docker sub image, but not the source code. The plan is to bind my local nauci source directory to a docker container built with the nauci dependencies image, thereby separating dependency and tooling concerns from project implementation.</description>

      <description>A quick note about my use of Literate Programming My blog is generated using a static site generator called Hugo. Hugo naively supports both Markdown and Org-Mode format, so naturally I have chosen to compose my blog posts in emacs Org-Mode. Org-mode is similar to Markdown in the sense that it uses a simple plain text markup syntax for formatting documents. However, Org-Mode has far more features than Markdown and has fantastic literate programming support via Org-Babel.</description>

      <description>About Me I am a software developer and independent contractor residing in Edmonton Alberta, Canada. I have been developing software professionally since 2001 and graduated from the University of Alberta in 2005 with a major mathematics and minor in computing science. One thing that I love about being an independent contractor, is that over the years I have worked for lots of different companies which has allowed me to contribute to a large variety of exciting projects written in many different languages.</description>
