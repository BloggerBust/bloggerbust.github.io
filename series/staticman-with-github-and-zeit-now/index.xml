      <description>What is going on? A while back I noticed that all of my cross post anchor links are broken. They no longer link to anchors within the post, but instead link to the post itself. I planned on resolving this quickly, but it turned out to be more involved then I had hopped. In order to resolve the issue I needed to first register as a contributor of GNU emacs which I discussed here.</description>

      <description>Why Staticman? I would like to add comment support to my Blog. The trouble is that I don&amp;rsquo;t trust comment engines to respect the privacy of my readers. Do I even have any readers? Who can tell! None of my posts have a comment section and I don&amp;rsquo;t collect analytics. Clearly this is a problem worth solving.
I recently came across the Staticman comment engine which uses pull requests to update static blogs with static user comments.</description>
