      <description>Motivation In my spare time I have been experimenting with the Bazel build runner. I wanted to add Libsodium as a dependency to my Bazel C/C++ project. The Libsodium project is not a Bazel package and therefore Bazel will not know how to treat it as a dependency. If I wish to add Libsodium as a repository based dependency to my project, then It makes sense to write a BUILD file defining how Bazel should build the Libsodium library.</description>
