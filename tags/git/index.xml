      <description>Why Staticman? I would like to add comment support to my Blog. The trouble is that I don&amp;rsquo;t trust comment engines to respect the privacy of my readers. Do I even have any readers? Who can tell! None of my posts have a comment section and I don&amp;rsquo;t collect analytics. Clearly this is a problem worth solving.
I recently came across the Staticman comment engine which uses pull requests to update static blogs with static user comments.</description>
