      <description>Motivation I decided that I would like to contribute to the ox-hugo project from time to time. I do not have pandoc or pandoc-citeproc installed locally nor have never used either before. I did consider emerging pandoc, but when I saw the list of dependencies being pulled from portage I immediately cancelled the install.
This command displays the number of packages, including pandoc itself, that would have been emerged. Most of those dependencies are from Haskell.</description>
