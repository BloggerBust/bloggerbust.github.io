      <description>Introduction I previously wrote how to configure minicom to connect to a device over serial UART. In that post I mentioned that minicom might not be the best tool for the job. Consider that minicom is adding a lot of unnecessary complexity. If you think about it, we are taking a command line utility intended for communicating with modems, stripping all that functionality away so that we are left with nothing more than a terminal emulator that knows how to connect to a foreign TTY.</description>

      <description>Table of Contents  Key-binding notation  Examples  Serial Communication  Comm Parameters Line Speed Additional Reading    
This is where I am going to keep supplemental material that might be useful to reference from multiple pages.
Key-binding notation I follow the emacs key-binding nation when representing keybindings in text. You might be use to seeing CTRL-A to represent holding down the control key followed by the letter a, but in my writings you will see C-a to represent the same.</description>

      <description>Introduction I recently wrote about my first experience connecting to the pinephone via serial console. This post documents how to configure Minicom for establishing an interactive terminal session with a device connected to your computer via a serial port. The configuration will be saved to file so that it can be reused to connect to the same device again in the future, which is convenient. My version of minicom at the time of writing is minicom version 2.</description>
